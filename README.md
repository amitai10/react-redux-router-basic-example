# React


What is React?
React is a JS library for rendering web pages. Thatâ€™s it. The closest equivalent is Angular with only directives. Without the other features such as services, controllers etc.


So why use it?
- React is fast. It renders the pages using virtual DOM, instead of rendering to the actual DOM, it uses the virtual DOM compare the changes of the page and then renders to the DOM only the changes.
- It enforces the developer to use software development best practices, such as unidirectional data flow.
- React native - react development and react native are very similar, and react native is excellent way to create mobile native apps.
- It allows server rendering.
- Once you understand the principles, it is very easy to write complex web applications.
- React has huge ecosystem with libraries like Redux, GraphQL, Relay and more that are complementary technologies to make a great development process.
